        %h3 WHAT IS FUTSAL?
        %p
          Futsal is a variant of association football that is played on a smaller field and mainly played indoors. It can be considered a version of five-a-side football.  
        %p
          Futsal is a game played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball with less bounce than a regular football due to the surface of the pitch. The surface, ball and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces.
